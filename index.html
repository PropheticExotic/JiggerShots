    <h1>JiggerShot Mobile Bar – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <pre>Can we supply our own drinks?
        Absolutely! You are welcome to provide your own spirits, and our talented bartenders will serve them for you throughout the event.
        
        How do I secure a booking with JiggerShot?
        Booking with us is a breeze! Simply contact us via email or phone to discuss your event needs. Once we have your details, we’ll provide a tailored proposal. To confirm your booking, we require a 20% deposit, which can be made through bank transfer. After that, we will send you a contract to review and sign.
        
        What forms of payment do you accept?
        We accept cash and checks. If you choose to pay by check, please ensure that full payment is submitted at least seven days before your event for processing.
        
        Do you create specialty cocktails for events?
        Yes! We love creating custom cocktails that reflect your theme or preferences. You can even suggest a fun name for your drink!
        
        What happens to any leftover alcohol after the event?
        Due to our unlimited service model, all alcohol remains with us after the event concludes to ensure all guests are well taken care of throughout the celebration.
        
        Will there be enough alcohol for all guests?
        Yes, we conduct a thorough assessment based on your guest count to determine the right amount of alcohol needed. If we ever fall short, we’ll do our utmost to restock quickly and keep the drinks flowing.
        
        How do you handle guest safety regarding alcohol consumption?
        The safety of your guests is our priority. Our staff is trained to monitor alcohol consumption and will step in if anyone appears to be overindulging.
        
        Can I hire extra bartenders?
        Certainly! If you anticipate needing more staff, we can arrange for additional bartenders at an extra cost.
        
        When will you arrive for setup?
        Our setup time varies based on the size of your event, but we typically arrive between 45 minutes to 2 hours beforehand. We aim to ensure everything is perfectly prepared and ready before guests arrive.
        
        What will your bartenders wear?
        Our bartenders dress professionally in smart attire—typically all black or white polos with black pants and ties—to ensure they look great while serving you and your guests.
        
        How do I estimate the number of guests to book for?
        A good rule of thumb is to book for at least 50% to 75% of your expected guest list. This helps to prevent any issues with overcapacity and ensures your event runs smoothly.
        
        What’s the difference between unlimited and consumable drink packages?
        
        Consumable Package: Ideal for events with uncertain guest counts. Guests can enjoy drinks until supplies run out, after which the bar will close.
        Unlimited Package: Designed for larger gatherings, this allows all guests to enjoy unlimited drinks for a set duration, typically four hours. Wristbands can be used for easier management of guest counts.
        What is your cancellation policy?
        Cancellations are considered a breach of contract, and unfortunately, deposits are non-refundable. The client is also responsible for any incurred charges up until the cancellation.
        
        Why should I choose JiggerShot Mobile Bar?
        At JiggerShot Mobile Bar, we pride ourselves on delivering not just drinks, but memorable experiences. Our professional team is committed to excellent service and creating a fun, engaging atmosphere that elevates your event.
